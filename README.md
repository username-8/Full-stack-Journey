# my Progress Journal

> This is sort of a digital journal document my progress in programming. At the beginning I am quite confused and all I have in mind is the project that I want to build. learning environment. 

## first quarter 

I'm from around between the OT course , W3, free code camp, the odin project. and few others. 
i am trying to get  a comprehensive understanding of where everything lay & how they interconnect & operate.

- As of september i am stuck between learning How the front end works (In theory & flow chart) & just progressing through HTML.
